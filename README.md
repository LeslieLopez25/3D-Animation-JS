<h1>3D Animation</h1>

<h2>A product card created to show a 3d effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h2>

<p>This project is created using a bit of flexbox, position property, and CSS custom properties. I created this following the tutorial of Dev Ed. I've changed the color scheme, image, and updated the values of measures from px to rem. I liked building this project, especially learning how you create the 3d effect using JavaScript. This project is beginner friendly.</p>
